# Documentation


## About this repository

This repository contains zipped documentation files for my various open source projects. I keep the files here to avoid bloating the project repositories with large files. 

I first tried [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com), but Xcode failed to pull in packages from LFS repositories, so I decided to store the files here instead and link to this repo from the various projects.


## How to open a documentation file

Each documentation file is a downloadable zip file that contains a documentation archive. Just download and unzip any documentation file, then open the unzipped `.doccarchive` in Xcode.
